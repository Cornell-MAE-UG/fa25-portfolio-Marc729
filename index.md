## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG_1728.JPG" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I am currently an undergraduate student at Cornell University planning to major in mechanical engineering and minor in business. I am interested in all aspects involving the design and mechanical components of automotive and aviation. I look forward to bringing my skills to industry, exploring opportunities, and making new connections!

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
