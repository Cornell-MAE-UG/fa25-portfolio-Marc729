# Overview
<hr class="section-divider">
The goal of the fluid mechanics dissection was to analyze a four-stroke lawn mower engine. Air enters through a filter that cleans the air and minimizes energy loss by reducing air velocity. The air then passes through the carburetor, where a venturi creates a pressure drop that draws fuel into the airflow based on conservation of mass and momentum principles. Fuel enters the carburetor from a reservoir controlled by a float valve, which regulates the fuel level using buoyancy and meters fuel through a small tube. The air-fuel mixture then enters the cylinder and proceeds through the four strokes: intake, compression (during which pressure and temperature increase), power (ignition), and exhaust. Finally, the exhaust gases pass through the muffler, where changes in flow area and internal baffles reduce velocity, energy, and noise.

# Personal Contribution  
<hr class="section-divider">

During the physical dissection, I assisted in disassembling the lawn mower and focused my analysis on the air filter. I examined how air flows through the filter using the continuity equation to explain changes in velocity and cross-sectional area. This analysis helped connect the physical components to the fluid flow concepts discussed in the video. The general diagram used to describe the lawn mower engine was constructed collaboratively as a group.
